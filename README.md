# CSharp-Advanced-SoftUni-2022

The [**C# Advanced**](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3699/csharp-advanced-may-2022) course examines the .NET platform, as well as working with the C # language above the startup. This includes coding skills, problem solving skills, familiarization with standard work tools (.NET Framework), word processing tools, linear and tree collections, and working with files and directories . Particular attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the basic tool for it - LINQ to process data streams. The course will also deal with asynchronous programming, and throughout the training course the students will be divided into teams that will have to do a practical project.
