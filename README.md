This includes coding skills, problem solving skills, familiarization with standard work tools (.NET Framework), word processing tools, linear and tree collections, and working with files and directories . Particular attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the basic tool for it - LINQ to process data streams. The course will also deal with asynchronous programming, and throughout the training course the students will be divided into teams that will have to do a practical project.
